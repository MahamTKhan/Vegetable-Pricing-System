This project focuses on the development of a vegetable price prediction system using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) time series models. The project has been successfully implemented using the Python programming language, encompassing tasks such as dataset formation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data normalization. A research paper detailing the findings including the comparison of LSTM and SARIMA model for the specified problem was also written.This project focuses on the development of a vegetable price prediction system using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) time series models.
